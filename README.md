# frc_computer_vision
Example codes and slides to apply computer vision on a FRC robot. 

### Slides
Kickoff_CompVis.pdf includes the slides that I've covered during the workshop.

### Codes
detectGoal.py takes frc2013.png as input and tries to find the number of goals in the image, the position of the goals and the distance of the robot to the targets. 

trackObject.py looks for a green circular object and tracks it from a live camera feed. If multiple objects are found, the largest one is going to be displayed.
